Installation---

-Copy contents of League of Legends ENB to the following directory:
  C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\RADS\solutions\lol_game_client_sln\releases\0.0.1.XX\deploy
  
How to uninstall:

To uninstall either remove all the files that you originally placed from the zip folder. The other way to uninstall is either rename or remove the d3d9.dll file from your league directory. 
  
-Note: 

When testing, running in fullscreen almost always resulted in bugsplat errors. No bugsplat errors occurred when the game
is running in borderless mode.

It is recommended to turn off any anti-aliasing via the in game settings menu.

Although this is just a graphical modification PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

I have been using this for a while with no bans or warnings. There are very old post of other people who made enbs for league saying that using an enb with league is safe to use.
